# Social Comments Moodle Plugin

## Description
The Social Comments block for Moodle makes learning more engaging by adding the following features (among others):
* subscribe to an activity/ resource and get an email digest informing you about new comments
* create a collection of the most important comments and activities/ resources of a course by pinning them to the pin board (e. g. to go through them again before an exam)
* check the comments report to see the newest comments or search through all comments

## Credits

The block is now maintained by [bdecent gmbh]()https://bdecent.de).
