# Social Comments Moodle Plugin

## Description
The Social Comments block plugin for Moodle makes learning more engaging by adding the following features (among others):
* subscribe to an activity/ resource and get an email digest informing you about new comments
* create a collection of the most important comments and activities/ resources of a course by pinning them to the pin board (e. g. to go through them again before an exam)
* check the comments report to see the newest comments or search through all comments

## Credits

The plugin was developed by [Synergy Learning](http://www.synergy-learning.com) based on a concept by [Björn Lefers](http://www.lefers.com) as part of his work in a project team that developed a [blended learning degree program in Business Adminstration at HWR Berlin](http://www.hwr-berlin.de/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaften/studiengaenge/business-administration-ba/blended-learning-format/). 

## Version

The plugin is released under [GNU GPL v3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). It has been tested and is running on Moodle version 3.3. at HWR Berlin (it has not, yet, been tested for Moodle versions 3.4./ 3.5., but we are planning to do so in August/September 2018). 

Please be aware that the plugin was designed to match the [Lambda Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/lambda-responsive-moodle-theme/9442816), which is not available for free.
